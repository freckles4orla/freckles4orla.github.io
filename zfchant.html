    <h1>The Choice</h1>
    <p>
        Let me tell you a story.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is a fragment of lore that almost no student gets told about, robbing them of something beautiful.
    </p>
    <p>
        This tale is open to anyone, but it‚Äôs in particular for the people who had such horrible teachers that they
        think they hate math. <br>
        It‚Äôs a sad proof of how bad math is taught in our schools that people think that math is about numbers, or about
        calculations, or about formulas, because it‚Äôs not. <br>
        Math is, at her<span class="footnote"><sup><a id="ref1" href="#foot1">1</a></sup><span
                class="footnotetext">"her" because in my mind math is a woman. Why? Because math is beautiful, so she
                must obviously be a woman. Duh.</span></span> root, at her core, as her deepest essence, the study
        of human reasoning. Nothing more. Nothing less. <br>
        Yes, there are numbers and theorems too, and there are a lot of complex ideas, but those are just things we
        built over the millenia. <br>
        They are like houses built on a mountain side, they may be nice, or ugly or interesting, but math is <em>the
            mountain herself</em>. <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        When building math, you must start with a choice, the only choice you‚Äôll have. You have to choose <b>which rules
            you want to follow</b>. <br>
        ‚ÄúChoose the rules???‚Äù I hear you say ‚ÄúBut I thought that in math the rules were already fixed, and just needed
        studying. Plus, you can‚Äôt <em>really</em> choose the rules, 1 + 3 = 3 + 1 no matter what you want.‚Äù <br>
        The reason why you think that rules are fixed is that the choice has already been made for you! And no one even
        <em>explained</em> there was a choice to be made! <br>
        Granted, the choice that was made for you is the one (almost) everyone in the
        world does, it‚Äôs sensible and it‚Äôs useful because if everyone agrees we can speak the same language, but it‚Äôs
        the not the only possible one. <br>
        Let‚Äôs talk about how math is born.
    </p>
    <p>
        Imagine yourself, for a moment, in a grassy field<span class="footnote"><sup><a id="ref2"
                    href="#foot2">2</a></sup><span class="footnotetext">This grassy field probably works best, but any
                field green enough will do in a pinch: <br>

        the hour is
        early, a light breeze flows and the first rays of a timid sun are painting every shape all around you. <br>
        The year is 66 million years BCE, big dinos (any big animal, really) just went extinct so we don‚Äôt have to worry
        about our surroundings too much. <br>
        We‚Äôve dressed for the occasion<span class="footnote"><sup><a id="ref3" href="#foot3">3</a></sup><span

        building math, singing the whole chant from the basic notes. <em>Gulp</em>. Were do we start? <br>
        You may be tempted to think that we‚Äôll start by scribing numbers into the stones, or drawing shapes with the
        shrubs and trees, and then invoking the basic operations, and onward throught the everything you‚Äôve learned in
        school. <br>
        But this isn‚Äôt school. In fact your school won‚Äôt exist for the next 60 million years or so. <br>
        The point is that numbers and operations, while being the ground floor, the hall that cubs enter math through,
        are not the foundation we‚Äôre looking for.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here we make The Choice, we choose our Rules, our Axioms<span class="footnote"><sup><a id="ref4"
                    href="#foot4">4</a></sup><span class="footnotetext">Axiom is the technically correct name. You can
                ignore the other footnotes for now, read them at the end.</span></span>. <br>
        While we‚Äôre dressed up (and we‚Äôre cute, and powerful), we‚Äôre actually just novices, so for our first chant we‚Äôll
        choose the simplest route, we‚Äôll just whisper the ancient runes as first carved by Zermelo and Fraenkel<sup><a
                href="#foot5" id="ref5">5</a></sup>. <br>
        Our druidic circle will be built upon a Nonagon<sup><a href="#foot6" id="ref6">6</a></sup> of menhirs, that
        will give us the strength to intone the whole melody of creation. <br>
        Let us call their True Names<sup><a href="#foot7" id="ref7">7</a></sup>.
    </p>
    <div class="bigger">üé∂üé∂üé∂</div>
    <div class="big"> LET! THE SONG! BEGIN!</div>
    <div class="bigger">üé∂üé∂üé∂</div>
    <p>
        Our first stone, to the North, is called Extensionality. Upon this rock lays our understanding of what it means
        to be the same, what it means for two ideas to be one. <br>
        Our second stone is called Empty. Unassuming, with no features, it reminds us of what is the essence of
        existing, that as void as we may feel we still are valid and important. <br>
        Our third stone is called Pairing. On this stone we celebrate close bindings, meetings of minds and body, where
        two become one. <br>
        Our fourth stone is called Union. Flat and large, it is the base of clans and alliances, where a multitude is
        joined toward a single purpose. <br>
        Our fifth stone is called Infinity. Pointing straight at the sky, it calls upon our immagination to embody the
        borderless, the unknown. <br>
        Our sixth stone is called Power. The fulcrum we can stand on to move energies beyond belief. <br>
        Our seventh stone is called Foundation. It grounds us and prevents our mind from folding on itself, it asks
        every creation to stand on it own legs. <br>
        Our eigth stone is called Separation. It gives us discerning, and the ability to carve out our creations from
        the mold that contains them. <br>
        Our ninth stone is called Replacement. It allows us to build our tools, and from them to build and refine upon
        their image. <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        The circle is almost complete, but there is a tenth stone in our hand. It seems so trivial, so small, surely we
        can toss it away and find it again, if needed, with all the power the Nonagon grants us? <br>
        The quest to untangle the tenth stone from the circle is a long one, and only two druids of incredible power,
        G√∂del<sup><a href="#foot8" id="ref8">8</a></sup> and Cohen<sup><a href="#foot9" id="ref9">9</a></sup> finally
        found the truth, the tenth stone is a choice unto itself, and while the circle can stand on its own without it,
        it will nonetheless be diminished from the loss.
    </p>
    <p>
        The last stone is called Choice<sup><a href="#foot10" id="ref10">10</a></sup>. We place it at the center of the
        circle, push with our palm to embed it deep into mother earth, and then leave the circle to join our brethren
        and sistren in singing the Melody.
    </p>
    <p>
        This structure we just chose is called ZFC<sup><a href="#foot11" id="ref11">11</a></sup>, in honor of Zermelo
        and Fraenkel and Choice. It is the easiest choice, but not the only one. And it is <em>our</em> choice to make.
    </p>
    <p>
        As the hymn of joy rises from our joined hands we see the spiral unfurl, Empty calling Pairing, again and again
        upon itself, as it counts and it build The Numbers, and as Zero becomes One and Two, and Three, and more, it
        heeds the call of Infinity, and The Naturals are born, and as Power joins the dance the colors and shapes start
        exploding outwards and inwards, for The Reals are born us upon this fields and upwards starts the infinite
        quest, and Union starts calling the Transfinite Cardinals to join in our rythm and as the Universe<sup><a
                href="#foot12" id="ref12">12</a></sup> is made manifest upon the earth our joy is complete, for there we
        can see everything that ever was, is, and will be. We are humans, limited, finite, and there will forever be
        parts of the Song inaccessible to us. But we have glimpsed upon the beauty, and our minds and hearts will never
        be the same again.
    </p>
    <p>
        The numbers, and theorems, and formulas are tools, morsels of the infinite knowledge that we tamed, and named,
        and made our friends. But math is not about them.
